# Introduction

This repository contains code and source data where otherwise not available for the analysis and figures in the publication "Gene fusions create partner and collateral dependencies that are essential to cancer cell survival."

Due to space constraints, most publicly available data from DepMap, CCLE, Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal, and ENCODE is not available here, but may be accessed from these respective sources as indicated in the Methods and Supplementary Materials of the publication. 

Additionally, results (including figures and supplementary materials) available through the published paper website are not provided here and must be separately downloaded.

# Dependencies

All analysis was done in R (v.3.6.1) using the RStudio GUI (v.1.2.5001). Select logistic regression analyses were carried out on a virtual machine with R software through the Terra Google Cloud Platform.
